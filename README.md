# Introduction

Server action is a term commonly used in software development to refer to a piece of code or functionality that is executed on the server side of a client-server architecture. It is typically used to perform tasks that require server-side processing, such as handling requests, processing data, and interacting with databases.

Server actions are often used in web development to implement server-side logic and provide dynamic functionality to web applications. They can be triggered by various events, such as user requests, scheduled tasks, or system events.

By executing code on the server side, server actions can access and manipulate data stored on the server, interact with external services and APIs, and perform complex computations that may not be feasible or secure to execute on the client side.

Server actions are an essential component of many server-side frameworks and technologies, such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET. They enable developers to build robust and scalable applications by offloading processing tasks to the server, improving performance and security.

In summary, server actions play a crucial role in server-side development, allowing developers to implement complex functionality, handle requests, and process data on the server side of a client-server architecture.
